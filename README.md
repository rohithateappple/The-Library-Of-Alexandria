# The Library Of Alexandria
A recreation of the brilliant 'Library of Babel' by Jorges Luis Borges.

When I came across Jonathan Basile's Library of Babel implementaion on his website, I knew I had to create one for myself. This was such a profound project for me, I said to myself if I created this magical library, I would've become a master programmer. But here I still am today :) Anyway, the project was created in C# and Visual Studio as a Winfrom. I'll add a link to the application, so you can try it out yourself. Yes, anything you can think of already exists!

### Limitations
Well obviously I couldn't store an infinite number of strings! So the core of it all, the character set is limited to just 32 characters - [a-z,.- !:]. Please keep this contraint in mind while inputting text. Next is the page limit, only 3200 characters per page is allowed. "pft so small" you say? Well how about you calculate what 3200^32 is huh? With the jokes aside, my library does contain an immense amount of information.

### Closing Note
I'd recommend anyone who doesn't understand the true value of this implementation to go check out a brief summary about the Library of Babel. I'm only saying this because I understand it can look very abstract and boring.

### What I Learnt
 - Cryptography, XOR, and Encryption.
 - Working in Windows Forms
 - Bit level programming/ bit manipulation
